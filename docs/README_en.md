# Mylang-interpreter

**中文版本请见 [这里](../README.md).**

A C++ based interpreter learning, the main purpose of this project is to create an interpreter for Mylang language.

## Requirements

Sorry for the inconvenience, but I have not tested other versions. I recommend using the latest version as much as
possible.
I used some features such as `std::format` and `std::println`, which may help you decide the `C++` standard.
Here are some development environment requirements:

- `C++23` or higher
- `CMake` 3.28 or higher
- `clang-cl` 18.1.x or higher (Windows)
- `clang-format` 18.x.x or higher (optional)

## TODO

- [ ] implement foundational Data Types and some basic operations
- [ ] implement control structures
- [ ] implement functions
- [ ] implement built-in functions
